# Russian Tranlation Program

One of my 2021 resolutions was to use Duolingo every single day, and I've actually stuck to it so far!

Duolingo has definitely helped me improve my vocabulary and made me feel more confident in my reading and comprehension skills, but what am I supposed to do when I finish the course?

This (in progress) project started out with me just playing around with the python translators/google library to see how it worked. From there, I decided to create a project that would give me random Russain sentances, have me translate them, and then check that my translation is correct. This way, I'll be exposed to even more vocabulary and will be able to continue my learning after I finish Duolingo.

Currently I'm working on cleaning all the unnecessary text from the dataset I'm using, but after that, it should be smooth sailing ⛵️
